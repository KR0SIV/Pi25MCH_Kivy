# Pi25MCH_Kivy

This is a work in progress android remote control head (rather remote display at this point).
You point it to an OP25 web UI instance and you'll get a nice little scanner output/display.

I want this to be a whole lot more but it's been taxing so I'mma give you what I have thus far?
